# grounding-stamp.sh — PostToolUse hook on the brain's search_ruvnet tool.
#
# The other half of ground-before-write.sh. When the model ACTUALLY consults the RuvNet Brain and
# the brain ACTUALLY answers, this records WHICH ecosystem products that answer grounded — one stamp
# file per product term, read later by the write-path gate. No stamp, no write.
#
# ── WHICH TERMS: the QUERY. WHETHER TO STAMP AT ALL: the RESULT. ────────────────────────────────
#
# Those are two different questions and the original version answered both with the query, which is
# how the gate quietly stopped meaning anything. Found by the 2026-07-26 F5×GPT-5.6 duel and fixed
# as part of ADR-054 §3 ("stamps mint ONLY on a successful grounded result"):
#
#   • WHICH TERMS still comes from the query, and must. The tool RESULT lists every repo in the
#     corpus in its "Searched 37 repos" banner — stamping the terms found in the result would mark
#     EVERYTHING grounded on every call and the gate would never fire again. (A check that cannot
#     fail protects nothing.) That original reasoning was right and is unchanged.
#
#   • WHETHER TO STAMP could never have come from the query, and did. A refusal, an outage, a thrown
#     module error, an empty result — and, since ADR-054, a "the brain is switched off" soft answer —
#     each minted a full 24-hour stamp for every product named in the question that was ASKED. So
#     the way to open the write gate was to ask the brain something while it was broken or disabled.
#     Measured on the pre-fix tree, in tests/unit/brain-off.test.mjs's recorded red run: five
#     distinct non-answers, five valid stamps.
#
# The success signal is the one line kb/forge-mcp-all.mjs prints on every genuinely-executed search
# and on nothing else — `Searched <n> RuvNet repos (...)` — with the four known non-answers refused
# explicitly first. Cheapest reliable signal in the payload: no parsing, no field extraction, plain
# substring matching over the raw stdin, all of it bash builtins. The refusal markers are quote-free
# on purpose: a PostToolUse payload JSON-encodes the tool response, so anything containing a double
# quote would arrive as \" and never match.
#
# CONTRACT: PostToolUse is non-blocking — always exit 0, swallow every failure.
